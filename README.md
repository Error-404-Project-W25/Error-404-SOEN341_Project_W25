# SOEN 341 Project - ChatHaven

## Overview
ChatHaven is a seamless communication platform designed to facilitate group discussions, private messaging, and role-based user management. Built with scalability and user experience in mind, it enables users to collaborate effectively through structured text channels and direct messages.
